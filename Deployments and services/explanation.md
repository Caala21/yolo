Kubernetes Orchestration with IP Addresses

This explanation focuses on how Kubernetes manages deployments and services using IP addresses (IPv4 specifically).

Choosing the Right Kubernetes Object:

    Client Deployment: This deployment creates 3 pods running the client application.  A LoadBalancer service is used to make the client application accessible externally. This service likely gets assigned a public IP address from your cloud provider, allowing external connections to reach the client pods. 

    Backend Deployment: This deployment uses a StatefulSet to manage stateful backend pods. These pods connect to a MongoDB database and require ordered creation and persistent identity. Unlike the client, the backend service uses ClusterIP, making it only accessible internally within the cluster using a private IP address.

StatefulSet vs Deployment:

    Ordered Pod Creation: StatefulSets guarantee pods are created and brought online in a specific order, crucial for applications relying on existing data. Deployments, on the other hand, don't guarantee a specific order.

    Persistent Identity: Each StatefulSet pod has a unique hostname based on its position within the set. This allows backend applications to connect and maintain state with specific pods.

Persistent Storage (Implicit):

Although not explicitly defined, the volumeClaimTemplates section likely defines a template for persistent storage volumes. These volumes will be claimed by the pods created by the StatefulSet, allowing them to store data that persists even after pod restarts.
